# rtlsdr-ft8d -- FT8 daemon for RTL receivers

## TL;DR

This project aim at decoding FT8 signals using an RTL device. Most of RTL devices allows reception of VHF/UHF signals (between 24MHz-1GHz). Nothing new here, this repo is just a patchwork of different projects, and do the glue to send received spots on Internet.

## The Good, the Bad and the Ugly -- in a single person

Well... I'm not a big fan of FT8. K1JT is a nice guy for sure, but he created a monster. It remembers me the book "LSD, my problem child" from Ph. Albert Hofmann :) At some point, something drifted I guess. Not sure what exactly, but the automation was easy and the lazy nature of the amateur did the rest. A programm that do your job when you sleep, it's free money! No? Well, again, not a big fan...

But at the same time, I'm a big fan of beacons, and when I see a map of RBN/PSKreporter, I see this as a giant beacon community. But seriouly, this kind of contact should be in a M2M (Machine to Machine) category, and FT4/FT8 contests make no sense... We just removed the human from que equaition. It's nice when you want to compare to different location, or antennas/setup, but it's not in our ham sprit.

Anyway, I will do this... Make the glue between my previous RTL API and a FT8 decoder (with some open licence). I will need your help, to test it, beacause my radio setup is very limited for now. 

@F5LEN : J'ai l'impression de mettre le bras dans le tordeur ;)
